Problem: When James Beard award-winning chef and restaurateur Barbara Lynch decided to build upon the success of No. 9 Park by opening new restaurants, establishing a catering company and creating a “test kitchen,” she realized her branding and websites needed to provide the same overall quality experiences as her food. Her existing disparate websites were hard to update and didn’t communicate Chef Lynch’s vision for each property. She needed a new recipe to brand and market her growing empire.

----

Solution: Whether we were refreshing her existing brands (B & G Oysters), developing new identities (for Sportello and Drink), or creating websites and marketing materials for all properties, we knew that there needed to be a consistent level of innovation and excellence that connected everything. We collaborated with Chef Lynch’s interior design teams to ensure that the branding we created extended to every touchpoint guests encountered. For the websites, we provided an easy-to-update CMS that connected all Chef Lynch’s properties to convey the unique nature of each and her impeccable taste.
