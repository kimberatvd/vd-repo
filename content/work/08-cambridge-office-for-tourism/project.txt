Problem: The City of Cambridge, long considered a laid-back college town known for quirky bookstores, underground bands, and art-house cinema, is undergoing an exciting cultural renaissance. Boston’s one-time bohemian sister across the Charles is fast becoming a mecca for foodies, theater lovers, architecture buffs, and tech geeks. The Cambridge Office for Tourism wanted to highlight the city’s diverse offerings in a way that would get the attention of a broader audience.

Solution: Visual Dialogue created an advertising campaign that speaks to savvy visitors, telling Cambridge’s inside story through the lens of its vibrant and diverse neighborhoods. “Cambridge is for Squares” focuses on the five distinctive squares—Kendall, Central, Inman, Harvard, and Porter—that form a cultural map of the city. A series of print and online ads feature Instagram photos of hidden gems—representative of each square—captioned with insights that call out the many reasons to rethink Cambridge. The ads tie to a social media campaign and drive traffic to the tourism office’s website, cambridgeusa.org.
