Problem: For over 80 years, the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) has been introducing to Boston some of the most important artists of our time. As it transitioned to its new home on Boston’s waterfront (designed by Diller & Scofidio), the ICA sought to raise the level of their publications.

Solution: Visual Dialogue designed a wide array of projects from invitations to exterior posters to gallery guides to exhibition catalogues. Throughout all these projects our design mirrors the exciting, evocative artwork shown at the museum.
