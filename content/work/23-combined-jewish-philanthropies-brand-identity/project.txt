Problem: Combined Jewish Philanthropies (CJP) helps support a wide range of worthy causes and organizations throughout Boston and around the world. The country’s oldest Federation, CJP has an impressive track record of connecting the community and making a difference. However, the previous brand identity didn’t express the organization’s dynamic nature and wasn't connecting with their desired target audiences.

----

Solution: Visual Dialogue worked closely with the CJP communications team to create a new identity that reflects the organization’s innovative spirit and positions it for growth. The comprehensive branding includes a new logo (which uses the acronym “CJP” as the primary identifier); design guidelines for sub-brands, business papers, brochures, HTML email, and websites; and templates for CJP’s annual report/calendar and case brochure. This influential organization now has a marketing tool kit that is both efficient and effective.
