Problem: The Coaches’ Choice trophy was awarded to the top college football players in each of the four NCAA divisions—think Heisman trophy—but votes are cast by the coaches rather than the media. When Domino’s Pizza, the sponsor of the award, first approached Visual Dialogue, they knew what they didn’t want—a typical-looking trophy. No crystal or silver footballs.

Solution: Visual Dialogue abstracted the pads and musculature of a football player into a dynamic, stainless steel figure. The 18'' tall trophy features polished upper surfaces and sandblasted lower surfaces bursting forth from a black granite base. The faceted figure we designed and sculpted created an iconic image of a football hero without portraying one specific position or race. While Domino’s Pizza did not know what they wanted going into the project, they did once they saw this.
