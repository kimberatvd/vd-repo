Problem: Ground is a landscape architecture firm with projects ranging from large-scale green roofs to public art to urban planning. The principal of the firm, Shauna Gillies-Smith, was previously design director at Martha Schwartz, Inc., one of the most recognized landscape architecture firms in the world. For the Ground identity and website the firm wanted a design which expressed both the “radical & practical” aspects of their work, as well as their focus on green roofs.

----

Solution: Visual Dialogue created an overall brand identity for the firm based on visual representations of natural “ground”—i.e. dirt, grass, leaves, sedum, etc.—filling the hard-edged, “man-made” Ground logo. By showing the materials they work with in creating their designs, the “green” aspect of what they do is emphasized. And their website allows for news, projects, images, and text to be easily updated as the firm grows from the ground up (pardon the pun).
