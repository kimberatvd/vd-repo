Problem: Despite being one of the best art schools in the Northeast, the Art Institute of Boston’s previous communication materials neither reflected the quality of the school nor attracted the kind of students they wanted. In addition, a merger with Lesley University left a great deal of confusion about AIB’s autonomy.

----

Solution: The design of the catalogue and website began with an online survey of prospective students. Based on their feedback, Visual Dialogue designed communications materials that feature the photography of actual AIB students that show what the school is really like. The website and catalogue work in parallel by adopting a similar structure and color scheme. The end result: more than a 100% increase in qualified applicants. (Yes, you read that correctly.)
