Problem: The Himmel Hospitality Group owns three very popular (and different) restaurants in Boston: the granddaddy of steakhouses Grill 23, the foodie favorite Harvest, and the energetic Post 390. Each property’s website needed to convey their unique dining experience and vibe. While the restaurant sites presented different challenges, good photography, messaging, and design were needs that all three shared.

----

Solution: Visual Dialogue created unique online experiences for the three establishments—relevant to each restaurant's features and fare.  All sites utilize dynamic photography showing every aspect of the dining experience—the space, service, and of course the food and drink. Content responds seamlessly to any device and is easily updated through a user-friendly CMS. The site launches were also coordinated with an integrated print and HTML email campaign.
