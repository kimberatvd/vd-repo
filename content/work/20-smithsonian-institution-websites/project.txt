Problem: The Smithsonian Center for Folklife & Cultural Heritage’s mission is to preserve and document Americana and World culture. As part of that work they house Folkways Records and host the Folklife Festival each summer in Washington, DC. While each organization contains a wealth of information and important archival documentation for both cultural scholars and the general public, their previous sites did not present their content in an engaging way, failed to show their interconnectivity, and were difficult to navigate and update.

----

Solution: Working closely with the Smithsonian team, Visual Dialogue created interrelated designs for the three sites that highlight their distinct content while also presenting a familial connection. A CSS-based page templates allows easy integration with the existing database as well as interactive components for features, videos, and photo galleries. In the words of Toby Dodds, Smithsonian Institution Technology Director, “the staff applauded (literally) the new sites.”
