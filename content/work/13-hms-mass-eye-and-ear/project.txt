Problem: Harvard Medical School’s Department of Ophthalmology is a world leader in vision science—their research funded from the National Institutes of Health—is more than double that of any other academic ophthalmology department in the United States. Despite their position at the top of the chart, you had to be an insider to see all the groundbreaking work it does. To increase visibility of all they have to offer, the department needed to share the impressive story of its partners, patient care, research, education, outreach, and the amazing faculty.

Solution: Visual Dialogue designed the department’s annual report to give the content a “magazine-like” feel that focuses the message and illustrates how all the disparate pieces fit together. A flexible layout throughout the 168-page book, select-focus photographs through the lens of John Earle, and varied paper stocks clearly show the innovation of this world-class department.
