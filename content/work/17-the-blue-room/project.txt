Problem: After 20 years as one of the best-loved local restaurants, The Blue Room’s visual identity and communications was making their audience feel “blue” and needed an update. Their previous website was small, buggy, difficult to update, and the moody black and used moody black and white photos that failed to convey the space's warmth and energy. Since The Blue Room is located in the epicenter of Cambridge's tech corridor and steps from MIT, the owners also wanted a cutting-edge way to convey information to their tech-savvy guests.

Solution: Visual Dialogue began with a refresh of the logo—keeping the circular form and Helvetica typeface of the previous version, but infusing it with new energy. The website was redesigned to feature vibrant full-color, full-browser photos (by Kent Dayton) that captured the restaurant’s “good + friendly” vibe. A powerful CMS backs up the site making site changes and updates easy, and print and email marketing keeps the regulars in the know.
