Problem: As a law firm with a big presence on Beacon Hill and one of the largest health law benches in Massachusetts, Donoghue Barrett & Singal had moved beyond their old-school image. The firm’s website was outdated and its logo was hard to read, let alone reproduce. With an eye towards growth, the senior partners were ready for a fresh identity and website that would help them better connect with today’s decision makers and attract the best new talent.

----

Solution: To gain insight into the firm’s challenges, strengths, and goals, Visual Dialogue talked with representative clients and hosted roundtable discussions with representatives from their three core practice areas: health law, litigation, and government relations. A picture emerged of a law firm that is collegial in spirit, collaborative in practice, and connected where it counts. Visual Dialogue developed a contemporary brand identity and a responsive site that features photos and videos that put a face on the firm and capture its interdisciplinary approach to solving clients’ problems. (The website was a Webby Awards Honoree in 2014.)
