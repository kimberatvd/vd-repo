Title: woody at 100 boxed set

Probsol: yesps

Problem: Pretty much everyone knows Woody Guthrie and his iconic songs like “This Land is Your Land.” But for *Woody at 100: The Woody Guthrie Centennial Collection*, Smithsonian Folkways Recordings wanted to paint a more comprehensive picture of Guthrie with a collection as rich as his legacy.

----

Solution: To represent the direct nature of his music, Visual Dialogue used a never-before-seen photo of Woody at life size on the 12" x 12" cover. Inside the 150-page book, photos, artwork, lyrics, and artifacts help give context to the 57 songs on 3 CDs and show the breadth of Woody’s creative output. “The Guthrie boxed set is perhaps the most ambitious indication of the continuing revitalization of Folkways records.”–New York Times. *Woody at 100* was honored with a Grammy Award for “Best Box Set or Special Edition Package.” (link: /work/grammy-video text: See Fritz Klaetke’s acceptance speech).
