Problem: When the owners of The Blue Room and Central Bottle decided to open a new wine bar in Kendall Square they came to us with a name, but not much else. How do you convey both the artisanal touch and the overall experience they intended to offer in the branding?

Solution: Visual Dialogue began with a visual brief brainstorm to uncover the ideas behind the new venture. From this exercise came the main ingredients of the identity—a hand-drawn logo to suggest the personal touch combined with a geometric pattern inspired by the Italian tile used throughout the space. The palette of bold colors with metallic silver pops against the natural materials used in the interior design. French-fold menus double as keepsakes, and a blog-format website keeps guests in the know.
