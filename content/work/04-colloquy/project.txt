Problem: *Colloquy*, the magazine of Harvard’s Graduate School of Arts & Sciences, reaches an audience of some of the smartest, most influential people in the world—including presidents, Nobel Prize winners, CEOs, scholars, and leaders in their respective fields. But the previous version didn’t look or feel smart. Uninspired design, stock illustration, and boring photos all added up to a publication which didn’t engage it’s readers.

----

Solution: Colloquy means “a conversation or dialogue,” so who better than Visual Dialogue for the job. Beginning with a survey of the best examples of contemporary magazine design, we worked with the editor to redesign and reinvent the publication to be as smart and sophisticated as its readers. Dynamic typography and layout combine with engaging artwork to highlight the content and engage the audience.
