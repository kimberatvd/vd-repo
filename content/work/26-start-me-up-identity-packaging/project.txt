Title: start me up identity & packaging

Problem: StartMeUp is an emergency jump starter small enough to keep in your glove compartment that charges your battery through the lighter. No getting out of the car and no jumper cables. Clever, huh? Unfortunately, the original package design was not. A cheap cardboard case and cheesy graphics made consumers question if StartMeUp would really work if they were stuck in in the middle of nowhere.

Solution: In collaboration with industrial designer Alan Ball, Visual Dialogue scoured automotive aisles and found that most packaging had a “macho car guy” look with a lot of red and black, checkerboard flags, and lightning bolts. We went in the opposite direction—bright colors, a clean look, “easy-as-1-2-3” logo, and a plastic case—to make it clear that when you need it, StartMeUp will work and be easy to use.
