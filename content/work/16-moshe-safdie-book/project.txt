Problem: Architect Moshe Safdie is best known for designing Habitat in Montreal, one of the seminal works of the 20th century, and his career has seen an unprecedented outpouring of creativity in the 21st century. To document his latest work, Moshe wanted to work directly with a local graphic designer who shared his aesthetic and compositional sense on the creation of his latest monograph.

----

Solution: Fritz Klaetke of Visual Dialogue worked closely with Moshe on every aspect of the 288-page book design. The entire layout of the book is based on the Fibonacci grid (“the golden section”), referencing Moshe’s use of geometry in his designs. The introductory essays are presented as books within the book while the project sections function as virtual “walk-throughs” of his designs. The end result, in the words of Moshe, “looks beautiful... thank you for your patience and great efforts.”
