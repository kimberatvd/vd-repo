Problem: Everyone has heard the dire warnings on climate change but what can the average person do to make a difference? And how do you communicate a complex public policy initiative to educate and motivate citizens? Environmental Tax Reform-Massachusetts came to Visual Dialogue with the mission of providing education, research, and support for a tax on fossil fuel polluters that are largely responsible for climate change. The revenue generated from this carbon tax will then be returned to the citizens and businesses in the state while creating a level playing field for clean energy sources such as wind and solar power.

Solution: Beginning with changing the name of the organization to “Climate XChange,” Visual Dialogue is working to help spread the message. The brand identity, website, and video we created helps citizens understand that they will be the beneficiary of the tax revenue and alternative energy solutions will finally be given a level playing field to grow. In the words of Jessica Langerman, President of Climate XChange, “Visual Dialogue has breathed new life into the genre of environmental non-profit websites. Distilling complex, detailed policy ideas into such a compelling format takes a truly perceptive and creative team. Visual Dialogue provided that team, far exceeding what we might have imagined ourselves.” We’re excited to see Massachusetts leading the country into taking positive action on climate change.
