Title: aib: top of the class

----

Text: The catalogue for the Art Institute of Boston at Lesley University (AIB) created by Visual Dialogue was selected as one of the top 100 designs of the year by Step magazine. The March/April issue of Step is available on newsstands now.

In the words of Nancy Bernard writing in Step,“…smart messaging, well-defined positioning, and smart design—without losing the wild, wonderful, wacky heart young creatives crave.”

The AIB catalogue has also recently received a gold award from the Admissions Advertising Awards and a silver award from the Council for Advancement and Support 
of Education (CASE).
