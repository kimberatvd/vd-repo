Title: spd: high marks for ed.

----

Text: The redesign of Ed. magazine for the Harvard Graduate School of Education was selected by the Society of Publication Designers (SPD) for the SPD 37 Annual. As part of the redesign, Visual Dialogue re-named the publication from the wordy and academic-sounding “Harvard Education Bulletin” to the bolder and more contemporary “Ed.” The copy, layout, photography, and illustration all work together to engage and interest readers. Chosen from over 7,500 submissions, the design of the alumni magazine reflects the leadership role of the Ed School in the field and it’s real-world impact. The SPD annual is the most prestigous design competition in magazine publishing— previous winners include Esquire, Fast Company, and The New York Times Magazine.
