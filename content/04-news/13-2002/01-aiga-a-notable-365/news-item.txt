Title: aiga: a notable 365

----

Text: Visual Dialogue has been honored as one of only five New England design firms included in the American Institute of Graphic Arts 365 design competition. In addition to work from Visual Dialogue, projects from Brand Equity, Jager DiPaola Kemp, Rick Rawlins/ Thomas Starr, and WGBH are also featured among the 106 winning entries from across the country. Visual Dialogue’s piece is an invitation to a lecture entitled “Design Culture Now” given at the MIT Media Lab by Ellen Lupton, curator for contemporary design at the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum. “This piece uses the medium as the message,” states Fritz Klaetke, principal/design director of Visual Dialogue. “All the essential info is pre-written on the Post-it enclosed in the envelope so the recipient can stick it directly onto his/her datebook or computer monitor. It’s also a kind of commentary on information overload that is part of ‘Design Culture Now.’” The AIGA/365 show will be on display in Boston for one day only: Wednesday, June 5th at the Boston Architectural Center, 320 Newbury Street, with a reception from 6–8pm.
