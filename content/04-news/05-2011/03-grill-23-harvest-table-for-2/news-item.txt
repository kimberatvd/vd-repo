Title: grill 23 & harvest: table for 2

----

Text: Following the success of Post 390, Visual Dialogue recently launched two new sites for the Himmel Hospitality Group: Grill 23 in the Back Bay and Harvest in Cambridge. The redesigned sites are now infused with a sense of atmosphere, energy, people and, of course, the food which makes each restaurant special. In addition to developing the new CMS driven sites, we also created intregrated online marketing and advertising campaigns. Looking for outdoor dining in Harvard Square with one of the best seasonal menus around? Or a special night out in one of the grandest settings in Boston? Then we’ve got a table (and a website) for you.
