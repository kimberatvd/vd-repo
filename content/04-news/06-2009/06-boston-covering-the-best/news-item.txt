Title: boston: covering the best

----

Text: Boston Magazine asked Visual Dialogue to submit a cover design for their annual “Best of Boston” issue—traditionally the best-selling issue of the year, but not an easy assignment. We created four cover options: one with type created from Necco wafers (chosen as a runner-up), one portraying the iPhone-obsessed zeitgeist, and two collaborations with assemblage illustrator Polly Becker. Be sure to pick up a copy to see Visual Dialogue client Barbara Lynch who won for Best Chef, Best Restaurant Debut (Sportello), Best Upscale Bar (Drink), Best Al Fresco Dining and Best Fried Clams (B&G Oysters).
