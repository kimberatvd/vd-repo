Title: central bottle: veni vidi vino!

----

Text: Inspired by Venetian enotecas—places to gather, eat, drink and buy wine—Central Bottle debuted in Cambridge this past weekend (along with website by Visual Dialogue). The store features events such as video sessions with winemakers Skyped in from around the globe, guest chef tastings, and a regular Thursday night wine bar. The website organizes all the goings on and allows the busy Central Bottle team to easily (and frequently) update all the content. Stop in soon for a glass or a bottle.
