Title: dwell: on and off the grid

----

Text: On newsstands now, the latest issue of Dwell features the live/work space of Fritz Klaetke (Visual Dialogue) and Susan Battista (Topic 101). The article “Boston Translation” is in the Off The Grid section and focuses on the sustainable features of the interior renovation, a collaboration with architects Stern McCafferty. According to Dwell, “each floor’s function is complemented by the external environment. At ground level, the office feels urban, with the city’s sounds and sights at close range. By the time you get to the fourth floor, the din dissipates and the windows frame treetops and the Boston skyline.” Feel free to schedule a personal tour.
