Title: annual appearance

----

Text: Visual Dialogue’s work was selected for Step magazine’s Design Annual 100, recognizing the top 100 designs of 2003. The web site for Process, a print production management company, was part of an overall branding effort by Visual Dialogue. The site uses a timeline metaphor with scrolling horizontal frames for each section allowing users immediate access to all essential information. The Process site, designed and programmed by Visual Dialogue, was one of only 12 web sites honored in this nationwide competition.

Also on newsstands this month, HOW magazine’s 2004 International Design Annual features two more projects from Visual Dialogue. The stationery system for Process (designed in collaboration with Rick Rawlins/Work) and the AIGA Boston 2003 BoNE (Best of New England) Show call for entries poster were both selected from over 4000 entries.
