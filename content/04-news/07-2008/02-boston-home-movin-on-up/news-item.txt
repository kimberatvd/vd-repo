Title: boston home: movin’ on up

Text: Fall will be here before you know it, so pick up the summer issue of Boston Home for a feature on the South End home of Visual Dialogue. The article details the renovation of the 1850 row house into a modern space for work (on the bottom 2 floors) and living (on the 3 floors above). This adaptive reuse project also won a 2008 Boston Society of Architects award for Stern McCafferty, the architects we worked with closely to achieve our vision for the building.
