Title: mitx: no small feat

----

Text: The smallest firm took home two of the biggest honors last night at the MITX Awards —the largest interactive awards competition in the country. With awards for both the Central Bottle and Smithsonian Folkways sites, Visual Dialogue was one of only five firms to win more than one award. These sites beat out stiff competition from companies such as Buick, Sam Adams, and Dunkin’ Donuts and agencies including Arnold and Digitas. Thanks to MITX, our team, and most of all, our clients.
