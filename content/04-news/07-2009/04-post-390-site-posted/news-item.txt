Title: post 390: site posted

----

Text: Boston’s first urban tavern, Post 390, opened this past weekend on the site of the old Back Bay post office at the corner of Clarendon and Stuart Streets. The website created by Visual Dialogue for this two-level restaurant and bar incorporates full-screen video to give viewers a real sense of the unique environment and experience. This “virtual tour” allows viewers to see the action in the kitchen and highlights the interior design which features a variety of dining options, from the lively bars to the fireside tables to the private dining rooms. We hope the website gives you a taste of what Post 390 is like—go try it for yourself posthaste.
