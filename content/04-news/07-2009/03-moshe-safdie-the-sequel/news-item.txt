The 288-page book, Moshe Safdie II, features his recent projects including the Yad Vashem Holocaust Museum in Jerusalem, Marina Bay Sands in Singapore, and, locally, the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem. We were honored to work directly with Moshe—a world renowned architect and a great collaborator. Check out the book at your local bookstore or online.
