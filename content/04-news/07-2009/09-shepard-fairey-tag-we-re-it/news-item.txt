Title: shepard fairey: tag we’re it

----

Text: Despite temperatures so cold that the wheat paste froze solid, artist Shepard Fairey created his latest installation on the Visual Dialogue building. Perhaps best known for his iconic portrait of Barack Obama, Fairey has been posting his artwork at sites around Boston as part of his goal of bringing art out of museums and directly to the people. Shepard Fairey: Supply & Demand will be on view at the Institute of Contemporary Art from February 6 through August 16 but feel free to stop by the corner of Rutland Street and Shawmut Avenue for a preview.
