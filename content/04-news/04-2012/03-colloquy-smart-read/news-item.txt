Title: colloquy: smart read

Text: Ok, we know that alums of Harvard’s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences are a smart crowd. Shouldn’t the design of their magazine be equally smart? We think so. And with that in mind, Visual Dialogue worked with the editor to reinvent Colloquy as a substantial, thoughtful, and engaging publication. (And in case you were wondering, “colloquy” means a “conversation or dialogue,” so who better than Visual Dialogue for the job?)
