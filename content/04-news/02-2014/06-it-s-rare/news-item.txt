Title: it’s rare

----

Text: It’s rare for a restaurant to celebrate 30 years in business but that’s what Boston’s classic steakhouse, Grill 23, did last night. Over 500 guests ate, drank, and reminisced about the good times they’ve shared there over the years (see #grill23at30). Visual Dialogue created the letterpressed invitation and giveaways for the party. We also designed a print and online campaign introducing the new first floor bar that opens onto Berkeley Street. Grill 23 is certainly a restaurant in its prime. Cheers to 30 more years.
