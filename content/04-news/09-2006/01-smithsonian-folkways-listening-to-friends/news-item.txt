Title: smithsonian folkways: listening to friends

----

Text: Friends of Old Time Music, a series of historic concerts featuring legendary folk musicians playing in New York City for the first time, helped change the course of American music. This “folk arrival” is documented in a 3 CD boxed set of the same name designed by Visual Dialogue for Smithsonian Folkways Recordings. We are pleased to see the collection selected for “Best of 2006” status by both The New Yorker and The New York Times.
