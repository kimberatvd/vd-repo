Title: aib: show and tell

----

Text: With the goal of increasing awareness and admissions, The Art Institute of Boston at Lesley University (AIB) asked Visual Dialogue to create a cohesive identity for their catalogue, website, admissions presentation and other recruitment materials for the class of 2010 (and beyond). To ensure that the communications materials resonate with these high school students, Visual Dialogue partnered with research firm Topic 101 to survey them online and then incorporated their feedback into the design. 

The resulting 200-page catalogue was shot entirely by current AIB photography students to convey the school in a real, uncensored way, while also establishing new visual standards for the AIB brand. The corresponding website adopts a similar visual structure and color scheme combined with more in-depth information, an engaging interface, and easy-to-update format.
