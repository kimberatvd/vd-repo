Text: Fall is back to school and back to Cambridge with the roll-out of our ad campaign for The Cambridge Office for Tourism. Our “Cambridge is for Squares” campaign uses Instagram photos to give an insider view of each of the city’s five distinctive squares—Harvard, Central, Kendall, Porter, and Inman—while connecting visitors to social media channels and cambridgeusa.org for more info. Look for the ads in magazines, online, and at your favorite visitor center.
